# SHACL Core support matrix (opt-in `FOR ?v IN <shape>` targeting)

> **Not part of the SHACL 1.2 Rules spec.** This in-house SHACL 1.2 Core subset
> backs the opt-in rule-to-shape targeting extension, reachable only with
> `{ extensions: true }`. With extensions off, none of this is reachable.

The authoritative source of what is supported is the three sets in
[`src/shapes/model.ts`](../src/shapes/model.ts): `TARGET_PREDS`,
`NODE_CONSTRAINTS`, `PROP_CONSTRAINTS`. The `support-matrix.test.ts` drift test
asserts every entry in those sets appears in this document.

## Supported

### Targets

| Feature | Applies to | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sh:targetClass` | node shape | instances incl. transitive `rdfs:subClassOf` |
| `sh:targetNode` | node shape | the named node itself |
| `sh:targetSubjectsOf` | node shape | subjects of triples with the given predicate |
| `sh:targetObjectsOf` | node shape | objects of triples with the given predicate |
| `sh:targetWhere` | node shape | data nodes conforming to the inline shape (1.2) |
| `sh:shape` | node shape | data-graph nodes `n` with `n sh:shape <shapeIri>` (1.2) |

### Value-type constraints

| Feature | Applies to |
| --- | --- |
| `sh:class` | node + property |
| `sh:datatype` | node + property |
| `sh:nodeKind` | node + property |

### Cardinality constraints

| Feature | Applies to |
| --- | --- |
| `sh:minCount` | property |
| `sh:maxCount` | property |

### Value-range constraints

| Feature | Applies to |
| --- | --- |
| `sh:minInclusive` | property |
| `sh:maxInclusive` | property |
| `sh:minExclusive` | property |
| `sh:maxExclusive` | property |

### String-based constraints

| Feature | Applies to |
| --- | --- |
| `sh:minLength` | property |
| `sh:maxLength` | property |
| `sh:pattern` | property |
| `sh:flags` | property (modifies `sh:pattern`) |
| `sh:languageIn` | property |
| `sh:uniqueLang` | property |

### Value constraints

| Feature | Applies to |
| --- | --- |
| `sh:hasValue` | node + property |
| `sh:in` | node + property |

### Logical constraints

| Feature | Applies to |
| --- | --- |
| `sh:and` | node + property |
| `sh:or` | node + property |
| `sh:not` | node + property |
| `sh:xone` | node + property |

### Shape-based constraints

| Feature | Applies to |
| --- | --- |
| `sh:node` | node + property |
| `sh:property` | node (structural: nests a property shape) |
| `sh:path` | property (structural: value-node selection) |

### SHACL 1.2 additions

| Feature | Applies to | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sh:someValue` | node + property | at least one value conforms to the referenced shape |
| `sh:rootClass` | node + property | transitive-subclass root membership |
| `sh:subsetOf` | node + property | value set is a subset of the referenced values |
| `sh:memberShape` | property | shape each list member must conform to |
| `sh:minListLength` | property | minimum RDF-list length |
| `sh:maxListLength` | property | maximum RDF-list length |
| `sh:uniqueMembers` | property | list members must be pairwise distinct |
| `sh:reifierShape` | property | best-effort (see limitation below) |
| `sh:reificationRequired` | property | best-effort (see limitation below) |

**Best-effort:** `sh:reifierShape` and `sh:reificationRequired` are evaluated via
rdflib reifier triples when available. Under the pinned rdflib (7.6.0) triple
terms materialize as plain tuples, so these are treated as vacuously satisfied
rather than raising. This is a dependency limitation, not a gate.

## Not supported yet

These raise `UnsupportedShapeFeatureError` when encountered on a shape:

| Feature | Reason / scope |
| --- | --- |
| `sh:qualifiedValueShape` (+ `sh:qualifiedMinCount`/`sh:qualifiedMaxCount`) | qualified cardinality not implemented |
| `sh:closed` (+ `sh:ignoredProperties`) | closed-shape validation not implemented |
| `sh:sparql` (SPARQL-based constraints/targets) | out of scope for the Core subset |
| `sh:uniqueValuesFor` | not implemented |
| `sh:equals` | property-pair constraint, not implemented |
| `sh:disjoint` | property-pair constraint, not implemented |
| `sh:lessThan` | property-pair constraint, not implemented |
| `sh:lessThanOrEquals` | property-pair constraint, not implemented |
| `sh:entailment` | entailment regimes not implemented |
| `sh:deactivated` | shape (de)activation not honoured |
| non-validation annotations (`sh:message`, `sh:severity`, `sh:name`, `sh:description`, …) | metadata, not evaluated (and rejected to avoid silent drift) |
